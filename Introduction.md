# Analyzing IMDB Data on the Command Line

# _Data is the new oil - Clive Humby_

## Introduction

Data professions (Engineers, Scientists, Analysts) always receive data from various sources and they have to quickly decide if the data is worth working on. This is akin to doctors who see patients with various symptoms. What almost all doctors do universally is to use their stethoscope first. But data professionals jump to write code in Python or R or some programing language or even worse try to analyse with spreadsheets. This is when simple command line tools are present at their disposal.

This tutorial attempts to open the data professionals to the world of exploring data on the command line interface.

# Is this not yet an other tutorial on command line?

Yes. At a distance that is what it might seem like. But most tutorials/books do this:

- Introduce a lot of commands; however without a proper data to work on one will now know what to use when.
- Take a stance that everything can be done on the command line; that again is like using the golden hammer. Command line is great for initial analysis but beyond that you will need to use programming languages

So, what we do in this tutorial is to take a dataset and explain how the dataset can be analysed on the command line. The same dataset is used throughout the tutorial because that is what you would do practically when you get a dataset.
